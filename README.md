## This is how I Wake On WAN for Cloud computing or cloud gaming from LAN or WAN using ISP router advanced configurations
This is how I WOL or WAN - Cloud computing/gaming from LAN or WAN â€“ Movistar router advanced configurations 
In this tutorial I will show the solution I use for waking up my gaming/working PC from S5/S4 and use it for cloud computing or remote gaming. 
For this I use the combination of two open-source software solutions that are well known. Sunshine in the host, and Moonlight in the client.
The documentation on how to configure these programs is very clear so in the corresponding section you will have link to documentation and a summary of requirements for host and client so you can check if this solution is good for you.
So why am I doing this tutorial?
I had a lot of trouble setting some of these things and maybe some of this info may help people.
